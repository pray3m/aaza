## Quick start

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
2. Keep changes focused and small.
3. Test the app locally in Xcode before opening a PR.
4. Open a pull request with a clear summary and screenshots if UI changes are involved.

## PR expectations

- Keep code readable and minimal.
- Avoid unrelated refactors in the same PR.
- Update `README.md`/`RELEASE.md` when behavior or release flow changes.
